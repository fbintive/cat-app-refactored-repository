# App installation and handling

## Setup app
Run `npm install` from main directory.

## Start app
Run `npm run start` from main directory.

## Testing
First, run `npm run package` to build an app in out folder and after that `npm run wdio` to run tests.

# Insight for the future

## Things to add:
- more tests, which did not find their way to the current app, due to lack of experience with electron and wdio
- add typescript to secure types and provide better security and standards for the future

## Known problems:
- for unknown reason, app icon in tray remains there after app is closed and only hovering over it, makes it disappear
